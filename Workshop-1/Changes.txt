After reading the feedback from peer I have decided to add some additional things: 

1. Multiplicity - numerical relationship between instances of the classes. 
2. Changed "RemoveBoats" from function like to logical data, value of an object.

Since I was late with submission I was only able to get that much feedback, thus editing my design even more
would be rather complicated (wouold argue against myself).
