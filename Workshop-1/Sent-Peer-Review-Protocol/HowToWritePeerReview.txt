Read the theory chapters in the book and other sources. You will need to motivate your opinions with proper references. You can not just state “we think that X is good/wrong”, or “Tobias said X was good/wrong”, rather use something like: “Larman states [1, p123] that in order to model X you should think about…this is also supported by Fowler [2]”.

Your peer review should have a References section. In this section references should be numbered in the following form:
Nr, Author, Title, Year/Date, ISBN/link

For example:
Larman C., Applying UML and Patterns 3rd Ed, 2005, ISBN: 0131489062
Fowler M., Presentation Model, 2015-08-26, http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PresentationModel.html

Use the guidelines we have presented on the lectures to motivate your answers.

Think like a map maker
Static vs. Dynamic view (a.k.a. Requirements vs. Domain model)
Focus on reality not software
Good naming (classes and esp. Associations)
Derived attributes/associations
Correct UML notation
Understandability/Readability

As a developer would the model help you and why/why not?

Do you think a domain expert (for example the Secretary) would understand the model why/why not?

What are the strong points of the model, what do you think is really good and why?

What are the weaknesses of the model, what do you think should be changed and why?

Do you think the model has passed the grade 2 (passing grade) criteria?
