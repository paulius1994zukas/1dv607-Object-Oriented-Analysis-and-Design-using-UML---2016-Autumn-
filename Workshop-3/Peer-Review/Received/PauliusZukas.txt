Review of Paulius Zukas's Modifications of the BlackJack game

These are my interpretations and they could be wrong due to me missing or
misunderstanding the logic of the implementation

RUNNING THE CODE
----------------

Due to my Visual Studio having a licence issue right now I could not compile the program. 
I ran the included .exe version instead.

UML Diagram
-----------

Drawing reflects the current implementation

UI-CONTROLLER DEPENDENCY
------------------------

An enum is used and the implementation is good and generic.

SOFT17 IMPLEMENTATION
---------------------

It is added to the game

WINGAME IMPLEMENTATION
----------------------

It is added to the game

CODE REFACTORING
----------------

Code is rewritten in CSharp I assume that this was taken care of at the same time. Not needed dependencies in Interfaces etc. are removed.

OBSERVATION PATTERN
-------------------

Added

PASSING GRADE:
--------------
 
A nice and clean implementation that for sure passes grade 2.
